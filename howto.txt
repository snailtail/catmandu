# These are mostly notes for my own benefit
# We are assuming that your MARC21 file is called shelf.iso2709 and placed in the folder where you are executing the commands from, as should the fixes.txt be.

# To make the XLS file: 
catmandu convert MARC --fix fixes.txt to XLS --file output.xls < shelf.iso2709


*********************
# To convert the MARC file to a JSON string:
catmandu convert MARC --fix fixes.txt < shelf.iso2709

# In case there is no Author in the first item of the MARC21 file (I need to investigate if fixes.txt can handle this):
# Copy the JSON-data (see above for that), Add "Forfattare":"???", in the first item, and then use PowerShell:
$txt = '<replace this with the entire JSON-string>'
$corrected = ConvertFrom-Json -InputObject $txt
$corrected | Out-GridView
# Note: when creating the $txt variable, you must remove the < and > and everything in between, and replace that with the JSON string instead.

# Or you could do:
catmandu convert MARC --fix fixes.txt to JSON --file out.json --pretty 1 < shelf.iso2709
# then download the JSON file, correct the missing author, and then import the JSON file as a JSON object in Powershell. 
# export it to a grid view or what ever suits your needs.

*******************

# Mental note to myself/Magnus in case of illegal characters in the iso2709 file:
# FÃ¶ljande kommando tar shelf.iso2709 och konverterar om och sparar output i moholm.iso2709
iconv -f utf-8 -t utf-8 -c shelf.iso2709 >> moholm.iso2709
